One of the important features of functional programming is that it has no side-effect.\r\n\r\nA side effect is any application state change that is observable outside the called function other than its return value. It cause more problems by concurrency in an application. JavaScript is single thread language though, execution environment (browser and node.js) process various task at the same time. To avoid side effects, we need to keep the state outside the function immutable.\r\n\r\nWe can declare and assign immutable primitive variable with 'const' keyword, and keep properties of an object with 'Object.freeze()' method. The freeze method, however, does not always make objects immutable.\r\n\r\nIn this post, I would like to explain why 'Object.freeze()' method is not complete way to make an object immutable, and to illustrate this, I need to deal with data type of JavaScript first.\r\n\r\n## Data type of JavaScript\r\n\r\nJavaScript has 2 kinds of data types. One is primitive, and other is reference. Reference type is object which including array and function, and primitive type values are below.\r\n\r\n- string\r\n- number\r\n- bigint\r\n- boolean\r\n- undefined\r\n- symbol\r\n- null\r\n\r\n## Primitive type\r\n\r\n```js\r\nlet p1; // declare variable\r\np = 1; // assign 1 (1000)\r\n\r\nlet p2 = 1; //assign 1 (1000)\r\nconsole.log(p1 === p2); // true\r\n\r\np = 2; // reassign 2 (1001)\r\n```\r\n\r\n| 1000 | 1001 |\r\n| ---- | ---- |\r\n| 1    | 2    |\r\n\r\nI declared a variable p1 and assigned number 1 to p1. Number 1 was not assigned to p1 directly, but allocated to memory first, and the memory address of number 1 is assigned to p1. Let's suppose the address of number 1 is '1000'. (All of memory address in this post is hypothetical to help understand memory allocation of JavaScript)\r\n\r\nI declared new variable p2, and assigned number 1 to p2. The same memory address, '1000', was assigned to p2. Number 1 is primitive type data, and immutable.\r\n\r\nAnd I reassigned number 2 to p1. At this time, number 1 in the memory '1000' won't be changed. Number 2 is allocated to the other space of memory, and its address '1001' is assigned to p1. (I would not deal with garbage collection to free memory in this post)\r\n\r\n## Object\r\n\r\n```js\r\nlet o1 = { name: \"choi\" }; // 2000\r\nlet o2 = { name: \"choi\" }; // 2001\r\n\r\nconsole.log(o1 === o2); // false\r\n```\r\n\r\n| 2000              | 2001              |\r\n| ----------------- | ----------------- |\r\n| { name : 'choi' } | { name : 'choi' } |\r\n\r\nObject is basically mutable. If I declare two variables, and assigned objects which have same keys and values to those variables, two different memory addresses are assigned to each ones. Object is reference type data.\r\n\r\n## Copy\r\n\r\n```js\r\nlet p1 = 1;\r\nlet p2 = p1;\r\n\r\nconsole.log(p1); // 1\r\nconsole.log(p2); // 1\r\n\r\np1 = 2;\r\n\r\nconsole.log(p1); // 2\r\nconsole.log(p2); // 1\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt is simple to copy primitive type data. Primitive type data is immutable, so if I copied then changed one data, it doesn't affect the other one.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n```js\r\nlet o1 = { name: \"choi\" };\r\nlet o2 = o1;\r\n\r\nconsole.log(o1); // { name: \"choi\" }\r\nconsole.log(o2); // { name: \"choi\" }\r\nconsole.log(o1 === o2); // true\r\n\r\no2.name = \"kim\";\r\n\r\nconsole.log(o1); // { name: \"kim\" }\r\nconsole.log(o2); // { name: \"kim\" }\r\nconsole.log(o1 === o2); // true\r\n```\r\n\r\n| 2000                        |\r\n| --------------------------- |\r\n| { name : ~~'choi'~~ 'kim' } |\r\n\r\nhowever, does work in different way. I assigned one variable, which is assigned an object, to other variable, then I changed one of that. It affects other variables as well. Object is reference type value, so both variable reference same object with same memory address.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n```js\r\nlet o1 = { name: \"choi\" };\r\nlet o2 = Object.assign({}, o1);\r\n\r\nconsole.log(o1); // { name: \"choi\" }\r\nconsole.log(o2); // { name: \"choi\" }\r\nconsole.log(o1 === o2); // false\r\n\r\no2.name = \"kim\";\r\n\r\nconsole.log(o1); // { name: \"choi\" }\r\nconsole.log(o2); // { name: \"kim\" }\r\n```\r\n\r\n| 2000              | 2001                        |\r\n| ----------------- | --------------------------- |\r\n| { name : 'choi' } | { name : ~~'choi'~~ 'kim' } |\r\n\r\nIf we did not mean to change the property of the original object, it could cause serious errors of an application. To keep the o1 object immutable, we can use Object.assign() to copy an object. (If it is an array, we can use Array.concat() as well.)\r\n\r\n## Object.freeze()\r\n\r\n```js\r\nlet o1 = { name: \"choi\" };\r\nObject.freeze(o1);\r\n\r\no1.name = \"kim\";\r\no1.age = 30; // even cannot add new properties\r\n\r\nconsole.log(o1); // { name: \"choi\" }\r\n```\r\n\r\nFinally we reached the freeze method. It freeze all properties of an object. we can block to change the original object from the very beginning with this method.\r\n\r\n## Const vs Freeze\r\n\r\n```js\r\nlet o1 = { name: \"choi\" };\r\nObject.freeze(o1);\r\n\r\nconsole.log(o1); // { name: \"choi\" };\r\n\r\no1 = \"hello world\";\r\n\r\nconsole.log(o1); // hello world\r\n\r\nconst o2 = { name: \"choi\" };\r\n\r\no2 = \"hello world\"; // Uncaught TypeError: Assignment to constant variable.\r\n```\r\n\r\nConst keyword is for immutable reference, and the freeze method is for immutable value. I declared variable o1 with let keyword and assigned an object to it. Then I freezed it.\r\nI can still reassign other value to o1.\r\nBut if I make same variable o2 but with const keyword, I cannot reassign, even though I wouldn't freeze.\r\n\r\n## Cannot freeze Nested Object\r\n\r\n```js\r\nlet o1 = { name: \"choi\", occupation: { job: \"boat builder\" } };\r\nObject.freeze(o1);\r\n\r\no1.name = kim;\r\no1.occupation.job = \"software engineer\";\r\n\r\nconsole.log(o1); // { name : \"choi\", occupation : { job : \"software engineer\"}}\r\n// name hasn't changed, but job has\r\n\r\nlet o2 = Object.assign({}, o1);\r\no2.name = \"kim\";\r\no2.occupation.job = \"chef\";\r\n\r\nconsole.log(o1); // { name : \"choi\", occupation : { job : \"chef\"}}\r\nconsole.log(o2); // { name : \"kim\", occupation : { job : \"chef\"}}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf values of one or multiple properties are reference type, aka nested object, both assign and freeze methods can not keep the original object immutable when cloning. They are called shallow freeze and clone.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nIf an object is nested with only one layer, we can freeze each properties with reference type value. It, however, is not easy to freeze all layers when the object is nested much deeper.\r\n\r\nI would like to suggest some alternatives in the following article.\r\n\r\n## References\r\n\r\n- [Master the JavaScript Interview: What is Functional Programming? - Eric Elliott](https://medium.com/javascript-scene/master-the-javascript-interview-what-is-functional-programming-7f218c68b3a0)\r\n- 함수형 자바스크립트 프로그래밍 - 유인동\r\n"},{"slug":"variable_declaration_in_javascript_modules","title":"Variable declaration in JavaScript Modules","date":"Sep 2, 2021","tag":["JavaScript"],"excerpt":"In module JavaScript, however, \"this\" refers to \"undefined\" in the top level context...","content":"\r\nThis study started with only a single line of code I did not understand.\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n// type = \"module\"\r\nconsole.log(this); // undefined\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Where the hell is \"window\"?\r\n\r\nIn the global execution context (outside of any function), \"this\" refers to the global object. If its runtime environment is a browser, it is \"window\". In module JavaScript, however, \"this\" refers to \"undefined\" in the top level context.\r\n\r\nModules are imported into the scope of single scripts. They cannot be called from global scope.\r\n\r\nModules have a lexical top-level scope. This means that for example, running var foo = 42; within a module does not create a global variable named foo, accessible through window.foo in a browser, although that would be the case in a classic script.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, the this within modules does not refer to the global this, and instead is undefined.\r\n\r\n## Variables Declaration\r\n\r\nAll variables in JavaScript is properties of objects, and a global variable is assigned to a property of global object.\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nvar a = \"hi\";\r\nconsole.log(a); // hi\r\nconsole.log(window.a); // hi\r\nconsole.log(this.a); // hi\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhat object is variables, declared in top-level scope of modules, assigned to?\r\n\r\nWhen variables is declared, it is assigned to a property of LexicalEnvironment component in execution context. The variables in top-level scope of modules are also assigned to LexicalEnvironment like any other execution contexts, but not global object like global variable. Only global variable is assigned to the global object, and then LexicalEnvironment refer the global object.\r\n\r\n## \"var\" and \"let\"\r\n\r\nFor both modules and commonjs, variables declared suing the \"let\", and constants are not assigned to a global property, but only LexicalEnvironment.\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nlet a = \"hi\";\r\nconsole.log(a); // hi\r\nconsole.log(window.a); // undefined\r\nconsole.log(this.a); // undefined\r\n```\r\n\r\n## References\r\n\r\n- [this - JavaScript | MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/this)\r\n- [JavaScript modules - JavaScript | MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Modules)\r\n- [JavaScript modules · V8](https://v8.dev/features/modules#mjs)\r\n"},{"slug":"neoquery_the_simplified_jquery","title":"NeoQuery, the simplified jQuery","date":"Sep 1, 2021","tag":["Library","JavaScript"],"excerpt":"I made a DOM manipulation library, and I was highly motivated from jQuery...","content":"\r\njQuery, which used to be a market-dominant library, is getting less attention in 2021. It is not an attractive option for new projects anymore, but legacy. Most browsers support web standards, and JavaScript improved a lot with ES6 update. We got fancy api like querySelectorAll() instead of getElementById(), and it is as convenient as jQuery methods.\r\n\r\nIn addition, jQuery is too heavy. In modern JS ecosystem, modularized library is recommend to use. jQuery, however, does have too many features. It helps Dom manipulation, CSS styling, event handling, animation, and ajax. They could be covered with modern JavaScript, or sometimes other modularized library like Axios.\r\n\r\nBut I believe jQuery syntax still works well. Especially its way to manipulate DOM with chaining method is still attractive. So I made a library, which is highly motivated from jQuery, and has similar methods and syntax, to manipulate DOM. It is [NeoQuery.](https://github.com/waynethebb/neoquery)\r\n\r\n## Fluent Interface\r\n\r\nA fluent interface is normally implemented by using method chaining to implement method cascading. jQuery is one of the most representative examples of use.\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n//jQuery example\r\n$(\"#textNode\").css(\"color\", \"red\").appendTo(\"#someDiv\");\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt is implemented by having each method return the object to which it is attached, often referred to as \"this\". Stated more abstractly, a fluent interface relays the instruction context of a subsequent call in method chaining, where generally the context is\r\n\r\n- Defined through the return value of a called method\r\n- Self-referential, where the new context is equivalent to the last context\r\n- Terminated through the return of a void context\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nClass Person{\r\n    constructor(){\r\n        this.name;\r\n        this.age;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    setName(name) {\r\n        this.name = name\r\n        return this\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    setAge(age) {\r\n        this.age = age\r\n        return this\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    sayHi() {\r\n        console.log(`Hi. I am ${this.name}, ${age} years old.`)\r\n        return this\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\nnew Person().setName(\"Wayne\").setAge(\"30\").sayHi();\r\n//\"Hi. I am Wayne, 30 years old.\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nI tried to implement chaining method with similar syntax as jQuery. I didn't export class, but export $() function which create instance of the fluent interface class, and return method of the class.\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nexport default function $(query) {\r\n  return neoQuery.selectQuery(query);\r\n}\r\n\r\nclass NeoQuery {\r\n  constructor() {\r\n    this.element;\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  selectQuery(query) {\r\n    const newElement = document.querySelectorAll(query);\r\n    this.element = newElement;\r\n    return this;\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  addClass() {\r\n    ...\r\n    this.element = ...\r\n    return this;\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  appendTo(query) {\r\n    ...\r\n    this.element = ...\r\n    return this;\r\n  }\r\n  ...\r\n}\r\n\r\n$(\"#textNode\").addClass(\"myClass\").appendTo(\"#someDiv\");\r\n```\r\n\r\n## $()\r\n\r\nThe function, $(), is to create new instance, and start chaining methods. It has three features.\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n$(callback);\r\n// Binds a function to be executed when the DOM has finished loading.\r\n// It doesn't chain methods.\r\n// ex) $(()=>{console.log(\"ready\")})\r\n\r\n$(selector);\r\n// Selects DOM elements with a CSS selector\r\n// ex) $( \"div.foo\" ).---\r\n\r\n$(html);\r\n//Creates DOM elements from the provided string of raw HTML.\r\n// ex) $(\"<div>test</div>\").---\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Methods\r\n\r\nI made all methods (except $()), have only one feature. It is to avoid unnecessary logic to categorize arguments for running different feature in one methods, and has more intuitive interface.\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n// jQuery\r\nattr(attributeName); // Get the value of attributes\r\nattr(attributeName, value); // Set attributes\r\n\r\n// neoQuery\r\nattr(attributeName); // Get the value of an attributes\r\naddAttr(attributeName, value); // Set attributes\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Other features\r\n\r\nI didn't create ajax and animation features, and minimize styling and event handling features. I intended to make this library as light as possible.\r\n\r\n### Styling\r\n\r\n- addCss(propertyName, value)\r\n- removeCss(propertyName)\r\n- show()\r\n- hide()\r\n\r\nI believe in-line styling need to be rejected, so I did not implement other styling methods. Unlike jQuery, those method can get only one property name as an argument.(\"css()\" the jQuery method can get object for css properties)\r\n\r\n\"show()\" and \"hide()\" methods was only exception. I think those methods are more like DOM control, and it does not conflict against other style properties.\r\n\r\n### Event\r\n\r\n- on(event, callback)\r\n- one(event, callback)\r\n- off(event, callback)\r\n\r\nI did not make other features to create event listener, but methods we can use with the browser event types.\r\n\r\n## References\r\n\r\n- [\"jQuery: The write less, do more, JavaScript library\"](http://jquery.com/)\r\n- [Martin Fowler, \"Fluent Interface\"](https://www.martinfowler.com/bliki/FluentInterface.html)\r\n"}]},"__N_SSG":true}
